Dependencies:
	libmodbus

Installing dependencies:
	apt-get install libmodbus5
	apt-get install libmodbus-dev
	apt-get install uuid-runtime

Build:
	run 'make' to build mbd daemon.
	
		make

	If you want to build a debug version of the daemon that performs
	no modbus communication, use 'nomodbus' target:

		make nomodbus

	run either of these targets followed by the 'install' target to install
	the program.

		make install

	The install target performs the following actions:

	* Copy the compiled executable file into /usr/bin
	* Copy the sample configuration file to /etc/mbd.conf
	* Generate a UUID, using 'genuuid', and place it into a file /uuid
	* Create the default sensor log directory /home/sensordata

	None of the above files or directories will be overwritten if they
	already exist, EXCEPT for the compiled executable file in /usr/bin,
	which will always be overwritten.

Test:
	The tests included are very basic- mostly simple regression tests
	to help ensure that configuration file parsing and other initialisation
	routines don't break during development. It's a good idea to run them
	before and after making any changes.

		make nomodbus
		make test

The default values in the sample configuration file placed in '/etc/mbd.conf'
almost certainly won't do what you want them to, so please inspect the file and
set all parameters to appropriate values.
