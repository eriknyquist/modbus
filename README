Dependencies:
	libmodbus

Installing dependencies:
	apt-get install libmodbus5
	apt-get install libmodbus-dev
	apt-get install uuid-runtime

Build:
	run 'make' to build mbd daemon.
	
		make

	If you want to build a debug version of the daemon that performs
	no modbus communication, use 'nomodbus' target:

		make nomodbus

	run either of these targets followed by the 'install' target to install
	the program. This will copy the executable into /usr/bin, copy the
	sample configuration file to /etc/mbd.conf, and create the UUID file &
	sensor log directory if required.

		make install


The default values in the sample configuration file placed in '/etc/mbd.conf'
almost certainly won't do what you want them to, so please inspect the file and
set all parameters to appropriate values.
