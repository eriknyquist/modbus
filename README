Dependencies:
	libmodbus

Installing dependencies:
	apt-get install libmodbus5
	apt-get install libmodbus-dev

Build:
	run 'make' to build mbd daemon. If you want to
	build a debug version of the daemon that performs
	no modbus communication, use 'nomodbus' target i.e.
	'make nomodbus'.

This program will look for a configuration file named '/etc/mbd.conf'
(example included with source).

In the absence of a confniguration file, defaults will be used, however they
almost certainly won't do what you want them to, so inspect the sample
configuration file included with the source and set all parameters to
appropriate values.
