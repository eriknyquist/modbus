Dependencies:
	libmodbus

Installing dependencies:
	apt-get install libmodbus5
	apt-get install libmodbus-dev

Build:
	run 'make' to build mbd daemon. If you want to
	build a debug version of the daemon that performs
	no modbus communication, use 'nomodbus' target i.e.
	'make nomodbus'.

In addition to the existence of 'libmodbus', daemon will also expect
a UUID present in '/uuid', configuration data in '/etc/abb.conf'
(included with source), and a FIXED directory to log modbus reads
'/home/sensordata'. Make sure these files & directories exist before
running the daemon.
